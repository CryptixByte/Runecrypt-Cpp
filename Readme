About | Runecrypt is a file encryption/decryption tool created using C++. I created this project as a challenge to improve my knowledge around simple encryption algorithms and file handling and manipulation. Additionally, I used my schools(Chemeketa Community College) basic C++ program template for my project, which conveniently handled backend aspects such as version control, editor configuration, and build automation. This allowed me to focus on writing the core logic of my program.

ETC | During the creation of this program, I found that I ran into exception errors if the user tried to run the encryption more than once on the file. This led me to discover that I had to implement an additional key for the program not to have an exception error if the user ran the program on encryption more than once. Additionally, I ran into a problem where my program encryption function would keep the original format. Additionally, the decryption function would not decipher the original content,
which resulted in me figuring out that my cipher keys were not able to cover a new line, so I decided to add something that detected a new line and assigned it to a unique key outside the cipher to allow the decryption to decrypt the original message including newlines fully and also solved the issue of the encryption not hiding the original content as much as it could.
